## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

QR codes are fast becoming popular these days. Most people are drifting away from the traditional mode of advertising/marketing and just storing their digital information online in QR codes. QR codes are everywhere we go now; banks, hospitals, hotels, restaurants etc. But the question on everyone’s lips is how do they come about these codes?

These codes are generated online by an online software called QR code generator. From secondary research, a lot of these platforms are not simplified enough for beginners to use. And to tackle that problem, we will be following the popular saying: “Less is more.” We will design a platform that allows users to generate QR codes with less hassle. The QR code generated can be downloaded, shared online amongst many other features and when scanned will lead to the user’s portfolio website or catalogue.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

A platform that allows users generate QR code for data inputted while also providing analytics and metrics.

The challenge
User: Unauthenticated

Visit the platform to view basic information about it
View and Interact with the documentation
Register to view more details
No access to use until registered
User: Authenticated

Full access to the platform
Allow setting on what should happen when qr is scanned - give at least 2 options
Allow user to download (allow png, jpeg and pdf download format), or share code by email or social media
Allow user save data and come back to it.

## ⛓️ Dependencies  <a name = "limitations"></a>

- django third Party libarys
- django rest framework for the api authentication
- swagger libary for the api documentation 


## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
 To get to the point where QR codes can be used for almost everything(like transfer of fund, sharing of account details e.t.c)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
